trashpanda (first_wideeye): Blegh! Fell right into a pile of the stuff...but nevermind that now, what’s that shine! ...*rustle*...
trashpanda (flat): Gah, just a piece of glass reflecting light... Well hey, I can throw it up as a mirror, the ladies’ll love it.
trashpanda (sexy): Yea…yea…you know, that’s not such a bad idea. Girls are always looking for mirrors to give themselves a once over. If I can get a hot date over to my new place she’ll be swooned for sure!
trashpanda (shine): What a find, boy oh boy do I love trash!
