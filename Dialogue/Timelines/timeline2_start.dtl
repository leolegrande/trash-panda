trashpanda (first_wideeye): Boy oh boy it stinks in here, and thats comin from a guy who’s lived in trash his whole life. I don’t know why I keep coming and poking my head around down in these sewers, never find nothin but trouble and the smell of human waste.
trashpanda (flat_grin): Who am I kiddin, beats raccoon waste any day. And I just can’t resist the thought of coming across something luxurious. It can’t only be in the movies that wedding rings get dropped down drains, diamonds and all!
trashpanda (wideeye): ...That lizards givin’ me a funny look…hey whatsittooya!
