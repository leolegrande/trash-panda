trashpanda (first_flat): Huh, musta gotten lost, I’ve never been to this spot before. Power plant is it? Not sure if they’d have any type of trash I’m lookin for at a place like this.
trashpanda (base):  Ah what the heck, might as well get outta my comfort zone for a change. At my age, if you aren’t careful you’ll just get stuck doing the same old thing day in and day out.
trashpanda (wideeye): Like that frog over there, just blep blep blep, bug, bug, bug… I mean for christ’s sake man snap out of it!
